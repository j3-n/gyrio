# Pkl Configuration

Gyrio uses Pkl to configure keybinds and other various settings, view the config.pkl to see.

config.pkl should live in `.config/gyrio`.

config.pkl should always amend `"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j3-n/gyrio/main/pkl/AppConfig.pkl` at the start.

If you have Pkl installed locally you can always run `$ pkl eval config.pkl` to check if your config file is valid.
